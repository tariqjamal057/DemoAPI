    question: "How do I get paid?",
    answer:
      "You get paid instantly via secure electronic transfer or certified cheque the moment we pick up your keys. No waiting periods, no hassle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why sell to Autobon?",
    answer:
      "Autobon offers a transparent, haggle-free experience. We provide firm offers, handle all the paperwork, and pick up the car from your driveway.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Autobon determine the value of my vehicle?",
    answer:
      "We use real-time market data, historical auction results, and the specific details of your car's condition to provide a competitive, firm offer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens on the day of pick-up?",
    answer:
      "Our representative will perform a quick 15-minute verification of the vehicle's condition, sign the final paperwork with you, and initiate your payment.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Will my offer change when it gets picked up? Is the cash offer really “firm”?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the offer is firm. As long as the vehicle's condition matches the description you provided online, the price we agreed upon is the price you get paid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why won't you purchase my car?",
    answer:
      "While we buy most vehicles, we may decline cars with significant structural damage, title brands (like salvage), or those that fall outside our current inventory requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does my auto loan get paid off?",
    answer:
      "We handle the payoff directly with your lender. We deduct the payoff amount from your car's value and pay you the remaining equity.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I am still driving my car. Does Autobon allow a variation in mileage?",
    answer:
      "We allow a reasonable variation in mileage (typically up to 500km) from the time of the offer to the time of pick-up.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sell my car for cash with Autobon?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! We buy cars for cash every day, whether you are buying a new one from us or just looking to sell your current ride.",
